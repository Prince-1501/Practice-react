## 🔥 HOOK (0:00 – 0:20)

Let me ask you one simple question.

You apply for jobs.
You send your resume.
But you never know…

👉 Is my resume actually good enough?  
👉 Is it matching the job role?  
👉 Why am I not getting callbacks?

Today, I’ll show you how to build an **AI Resume Analyzer** that answers all of this —  
and it even **emails you a full resume report automatically**.

And the best part?  
We’re building everything on **Replit** 🚀

---

## 🧠 PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:20 – 1:00)

Most students and job seekers:
- Don’t know if their resume is ATS-friendly
- Don’t know what skills are missing
- Apply blindly to different roles with the same resume

So I thought —
why not build an AI tool that:
- Reads your resume
- Understands the role you’re applying for
- Scores your resume
- And sends detailed feedback via email

That’s exactly what we’re building today.

## 🚀 PROJECT INTRO (1:00 – 1:40)

The project is called:

### **ResumeIQ – AI Resume Analyzer**

What this app does:
- Upload your resume as a **PDF**
- Select the role you’re applying for  
  (Backend, Frontend, HR, or Custom)
- AI analyzes and scores your resume
- You instantly see your score
- And a **detailed report is sent to your email**

All built using **Replit + AI + Integrations**.

---

## 🛠️ WHY REPLIT? (1:40 – 2:20)

I’m using Replit because:
- No local setup
- No dependency headache
- Frontend + backend in one place
- AI helps with coding and debugging
- Easy deployment

This is exactly how beginners should build AI apps in 2025.

---

## 📂 FEATURE 1: RESUME UPLOAD (2:20 – 3:20)

First feature — **Resume Upload**.

Users upload their resume as a **PDF file**.
The app:
- Extracts text from the PDF
- Prepares it for AI analysis

No manual copy-paste.
Everything automated.

---

## 🎯 FEATURE 2: ROLE-BASED EVALUATION (3:20 – 4:30)

Now comes the smart part.

The user selects the role they’re applying for:
- Backend Developer
- Frontend Developer
- HR / Human Resources
- Other (custom input)

Based on this role:
- AI changes its evaluation logic
- Scores the resume differently

And if the user doesn’t select anything —
AI still evaluates using **general best practices**.

---

## 🤖 FEATURE 3: AI RESUME ANALYSIS (4:30 – 6:00)

Now AI does its magic.

It generates:
- Resume score (out of 100)
- Strengths
- Missing skills or sections
- ATS-friendly improvement tips
- Clear action items

This is not generic feedback —
it’s **role-aware and practical**.

---

## ⏳ UX MOMENT: LOADING & PROGRESS (6:00 – 6:40)

While AI is processing,
we don’t show a blank screen.

Instead:
- Loading animation
- Friendly messages like:
  - “Analyzing your resume…”
  - “Scoring based on your job role…”

This makes the app feel **professional and real**.

---

## 📊 SCORE REVEAL IN UI (6:40 – 7:30)

Once analysis is done:
- Resume score is shown instantly on the UI
- Clear visual feedback
- Easy to understand

This is the moment users care about the most.

---

## 📩 FEATURE 4: EMAIL REPORT AUTOMATION (7:30 – 8:40)

Now the best part.

AI generates a **clean, professional resume report**
and sends it directly to the user’s email using **Gmail integration**.

The email includes:
- Resume score
- Role-based feedback
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Improvement tips
- Final recommendation

And on the UI we show:
> “📩 Your detailed resume report has been sent successfully.”

---

## 🧩 TECH STACK OVERVIEW (8:40 – 9:30)

Quick tech stack recap:
- Replit (Full-stack app)

Simple stack.
Powerful result.
